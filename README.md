# Project-3
Implementation of a Warehouse Storage Numbering System with SKUs.  We made six different hash functions that hash according to the six digit SKU of an item.  We have also provided an accompanying function that will calculate which of the six hash functions will lead to a hashtable with the lowest balancing factor.
